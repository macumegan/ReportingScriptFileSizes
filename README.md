# ReportingScriptFileSizes
Python script in a single file that will traverse the filesystem finding the largest files in a path.


I create a new Github repository with a README and a single python file.

The Python script accept an argument to traverse any path.

I was use different options in the script for reporting, like: 
    No more than 20 files.

    Files larger  than a specific size in megabytes.

I completed a project in GitHub with a README.md and a video reference in my GitHub Project.
